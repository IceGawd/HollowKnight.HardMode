HardMode
- This is a simple mod to make Hollow Knight harder for experienced players. It is meant to be an easier version of HellMode or GodSoul since those ones make combat a chore and not worth it.
- The mod can be toggled at any time from the ingame mod menu, with no permanent save changes
- This mod requires SeanprCore as a dependency
- The following are its effects
	- All charm costs are increased by 1
	- Maximum masks are decreased by 2
	- Nail damage is decreased, using the formula dmg = 3 + 3 * upgrades. (compare: base game gives dmg = 5 + 4 * upgrades)
	- Soul collection is decreased by 4 per nail hit (with no charms, 4.5 hits now allows a spell or focus)
	- Focus time is doubled
	- Geo dropped by enemies (not bosses) is doubled to make combat worth more
